# Green Volunteers

## 📌 Project Overview
Green Volunteers is an application designed to promote volunteering and encourage a sustainable mindset among young people. The platform connects individuals willing to offer their services with companies or organizations in need of assistance.

## 🛠️ Development Process
The project was divided into two main phases:

### 1️⃣ **Design & Prototyping**
- Created mockups in **Figma** for four types of users:
  - Non-logged-in users
  - Companies
  - Volunteers
  - Administrators

### 2️⃣ **Implementation**
- Developed using **JavaScript** and tools such as **React Native** and **Expo**.
- Initially, the backend was built using **AWS**, leveraging services like:
  - **Lambda**
  - **S3**
  - **DynamoDB**
  - **Cognito**
  - **API Gateway**
- Due to project requirements, the backend was later migrated to **Firebase**.

## 💬 Chat Functionality
Green Volunteers includes a built-in chat feature that allows:
- **One-on-one messaging** between volunteers and organizations.
